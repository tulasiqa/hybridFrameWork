The PERFECT WARM MARKET 
PRODUCT SCRIPT 
 
I believe the perfect way to introduce your warm market to your 
product or service is a letter asking for a referral, followed 
up by a phone call. 
 
 
 
Hello <First name>, 
The purpose of this letter is to let you know that <your spouse> and I have started a new business working from home. 
 
We are really excited about the company we are working with, Fortune Hi Tech Marketing , www.profitwithfortune.com 
 
We will be able to help those we care about list product benefits here 
 
We need a favor, can you help us out? Please read over the enclosed brochure and then pass it along to someone who you feel can benefit by saving money with the valuable services we offer/ benefit from this unique health product, etc. I am sure they will appreciate that, and we will too. 
 
I appreciate your help and I’ll give you a call in a couple of days to find out who received the brochure from you. 
 
Thank You for Your Help! 
<your name> 
<your phone number>

FOLLOW UP PHONE SCRIPT ON 
PRODUCT REFERAL LETTER 
 
We recommend that new distributors send 10 letters with a 
brochure a week and follow up with a phone call. REMEMBER when 
you call back, you subconsciously hope THEY HAVE NOT passed your 
brochure to anyone. 
 

Hello _(name)____________ this is Harry Brown I just wanted to 
call and make sure you received the letter I sent you a 
couple of days ago and see who you have passed my brochure along 
to? 
 
WAIT FOR RESPONSE 99% of the time they will say something like, 
Yes, I got it, but I haven’t given the brochure to anyone yet, 
your response…. 
 
NO PROBLEM, Who were you going to give it to? 
 
WAIT FOR RESPONSE, they will usually say my brother, 
sister. Co-worker, etc. 
Can you do me a favor? 
Wait for Response 
 
Just pass that brochure along to someone else and I will mail 
one to your brother, sister, co-worker, etc. what is there 
address? 
 
Do you see what has happened, you now have control and the 
opportunity to send a brochure to a great prospect. 
 
IMPORTANT CONCEPT YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT AND INTERNALIZE 
The odds of the person being the one you are looking 
for is slim to none, the odds of them KNOWING THE 
RIGHT PERSON is extremely high!
