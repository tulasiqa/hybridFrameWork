marketing"? Ask a couple of more questions then…… 
 
Based upon what you have shared with me I would 
like to go to step 2 and send you a DVD that 
will give you an overview of our company and 
compensation system. 
 
If you don’t feel the prospect is excellent, you 
may choose to send them to a website that gives a 
complete overview of your opportunity, and tell 
them they will need to review the website and then 
call you back within 24 hours if they would like to 
be considered for one of the 3 spots you have 
available.

An interest in what you see and you feel you
