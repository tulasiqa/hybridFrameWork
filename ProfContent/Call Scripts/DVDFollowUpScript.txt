SIDENOTE: 
 
I believe we are all looking for the RIGHT PEOPLE at the RIGHT 
TIME in their life. I do not believe in “Closing” people into 
a MLM down line. 
If you close them, you will have to BEG THEM to do 
Something. Your time is the most valuable asset you have; don’t 
waste it with the wrong people. 
 
Thank you for your support. 
 
Dedicated to Your Success, 
Harry S. Brown
