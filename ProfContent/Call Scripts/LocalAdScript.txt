LOCAL ADVERTISING SCRIPT 
 
I am assuming that all local advertising you do is being directed 
into a local voice mail box I don’t think you should ever take 
direct calls from your advertising 
efforts, you should always direct prospects to a local voice mail 
box. 
 
Hi (Prospects Name) 
This is Your Name/Harry Brown with Fortune Hi 
Tech Marketing, you responded to 
 
(Type of advertising: postcard, cable TV ad, direct mail 
letter, newspaper ad, door hanger, etc.) 
(First Name) can you tell me why you 
Responded to the (type of advertising) and what 
you might be looking for? 
 
At this point their response will tell you a lot you 
are looking for someone who is seriously 
looking, now someone who is just curious. 
 
 
What is your current profession? 
Do you consider yourself teachable? 
Are you willing to follow a proven system for 
wealth generation?  
 
 
Do you have any leadership or management 
experience in or out of the work place? 
 
Based upon what you have shared with me I would 
like to go to step 2 and send you a DVD that 
will give you an overview of our company and 
compensation system. 
 
If you don’t feel the prospect is excellent, you 
may choose to send them to a website that gives a 
complete overview of your opportunity, and tell 
them they will need to review the website and then 
call you back within 24 hours if they would like to 
be considered for one of the 3 spots you have 
available. 
 
 
I have your address as (their address from voice 
mail) and your email as (email from voice mail) 
is this correct? 
After you have watched the DVD if you have 
an interest in what you see and you feel you 
are the type of person we are looking for I 
will need for you to call me back and we can 
discuss your qualifications in more detail, 
ok? 

END CALL
